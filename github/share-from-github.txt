bottom fucking line: || tl;dr:

append the following:
?raw=true


/\/\/\/\\/\/\/\/\/\/\/\\\\\/\/\/\\\/\/\\\/\/\/\
while both google and github are similar I'll keep this one short.

for full deets go fucking look in the google drive on (lift and sift nagga)

or for the lazy:
https://github.com/xbl3/gDirect/blob/master/gdrive/share-from-google-drive.txt



github only needs: 
?raw=true



example:
https://github.com/xbl3/BATCHelor/blob/master/bin/fdf.exe 
{ dont do shit and can't download direct (outside tools) }


https://github.com/xbl3/BATCHelor/blob/master/bin/fdf.exe?raw=true
[ fuckin money ]
